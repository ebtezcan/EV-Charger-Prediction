    "> <font size=4em>The Data Science Process we'll be using during this section--OSEMiN (pronounced \"OH-sum\", rhymes with \"possum\").  This is the most straightforward of the Data Science Processes discussed so far.  **Note that during this process, just like the others, the stages often blur together.***  It is completely acceptable (and ***often a best practice!) to float back and forth** between stages as you learn new things about your problem, dataset, requirements, etc.  \n",
    "It's quite common to get to the modeling step and realize that you need to scrub your data a bit more or engineer a different feature and jump back to the \"Scrub\" stage, or go all the way back to the \"Obtain\" stage when you realize your current data isn't sufficient to solve this problem. \n",

    "- This step involves understanding stakeholder requirements, gathering information on the problem, and finally sourcing data that we think will be necessary for solving this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SCRUB**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this stage, we'll focus on preprocessing our data.  Important steps such as identifying and removing null values, dealing with outliers, normalizing data, and feature engineering/feature selection are handled around this stage.  The line with this stage really blurs with the _Explore_ stage, as it is common to only realize that certain columns require cleaning or preprocessing as a result of the visualzations and explorations done during Step 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that although technically, categorical data should be one-hot encoded during this step, in practice, it's usually done after data exploration.  This is because it is much less time-consuming to visualize and explore a few columns containing categorical data than it is to explore many different dummy columns that have been one-hot encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXPLORE**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This step focuses on getting to know the dataset you're working with. As mentioned above, this step tends to blend with the _Scrub_ step mentioned above.  During this step, you'll create visualizations to really get a feel for your dataset.  You'll focus on things such as understanding the distribution of different columns, checking for multicollinearity, and other tasks liek that.  If your project is a classification task, you may check the balance of the different classes in your dataset.  If your problem is a regression task, you may check that the dataset meets the assumptions necessary for a regression task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- At the end of this step, you should have a dataset ready for modeling that you've thoroughly explored and are extremely familiar with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**MODEL**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This step, as with the last two frameworks, is also pretty self-explanatory. It consists of building and tuning models using all the tools you have in your data science toolbox.  In practice, this often means defining a threshold for success, selecting machine learning algorithms to test on the project, and tuning the ones that show promise to try and increase your results.  As with the other stages, it is both common and accepted to realize something, jump back to a previous stage like _Scrub_ or _Explore_, and make some changes to see how it affects the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**iNTERPRET**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this step, you'll interpret the results of your model(s), and communicate results to stakeholders.  As with the other frameworks, communication is incredibily important! During this stage, you may come to realize that further investigation is needed, or more data.  That's totally fine--figure out what's needed, go get it, and start the process over! If your results are satisfactory to all stakeholders involved, you may also go from this stage right into productionizing your model and automating processes necessary to support it.  \n",
